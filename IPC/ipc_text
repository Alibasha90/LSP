 Comparison between Various IPC
Comparison of IPC
Pipes:
-----
Advantages:-

1) Simplest from of IPC
2) Can be used in shell
Disadvantages
1) Only for related process
2) No message boundary

FIFO:
-----

Disadvantages:-

-----> Data cannot be broadcasted to multiple receivers
-----> If there are multiple receivers there is not way to direct the data to particular user
-----> Cannot be used across network
-----> Less secure than pipe, since any process with valid access permission can access them
-----> Cannot store data
-----> No message boundaries. Data is treated as stream of bytes

Message Queues:-
-----------------

Advantages:

1) can broadcast data ????
2) can direct data
3) can store data
4) message boundaries

disadvantage:

1) effective for small amount of data
2) very expensive for large data, as transferred through kernel buffer and double coping
3) each data transfer involves 2 data copy operations
4) a message queue cannot be reused, since once the message is taken from the queue , message is removed from message queue.

Shared memory:
-------------
1) faster method than queues
2) does not require extra kernel buffer
3) safe, manipulated like other variables

Disadvantages:

1) data can either read or written only. Append is not possible
2) race condition is possible so locking is required.
